description: Ensures that directives not implement conflicting lifecycle interfaces.
descriptionDetails: 'See more at https://angular.io/api/core/DoCheck#description.'
options: null
optionsDescription: Not configurable.
rationale: |-

  A directive typically should not use both DoCheck and OnChanges to respond
  to changes on the same input, as ngOnChanges will continue to be called when the
  default change detector detects changes.
